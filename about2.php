        Welcome to MediVault, a secure and reliable platform that provides a
        database to store all your medical reports in one place. We understand
        that patients often struggle to keep track of their medical reports, and
        that's why we have created this website to provide an easy-to-use
        solution.
        <br><br>
        Our website allows users and hospitals to create accounts, where
        hospitals can directly upload reports, and users can access them
        anytime, anywhere. We believe that this platform has the potential to
        revolutionize the way medical reports are managed and accessed, making
        it a valuable addition to the healthcare industry.
